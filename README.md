# minasender
an easy bash script to send  MINA PROTOCOL tokens in Bulk from a LIST of ADDRESS.
the script ask for

-the amount to send

-the fee to pay

-unlock your wallet to send those transactions.

dont forget: you must have a full node synced with all the environment variable ready and setting up in .bashrc or .profile
**for private reason and avoid spam i will not include the Mina Protocol address inside mina_Users_address.txt , you have to collected/find it and add it one by line**
